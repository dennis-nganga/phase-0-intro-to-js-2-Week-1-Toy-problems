Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator
This repository contains three toy problems written in JavaScript by Kimani Nganga. Each challenge is described below, along with instructions on how to use the code and what it does.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
The Student Grade Generator is a simple JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter a student's marks and calculates the corresponding grade using a set of if-else statements. The grading system used is based on a scale of A to E.

Usage
To use the Student Grade Generator, simply run the code and follow the prompts to enter a student's marks. The calculated grade will then be logged to the console.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector
The Speed Detector is a JavaScript program that checks whether a driver is exceeding the speed limit. If the driver's speed is less than or equal to the speed limit of 70 km/h, the function logs "Ok" to the console. If the driver's speed is greater than the speed limit, the function calculates the number of demerit points the driver should receive. If the number of points is greater than or equal to 12, the function logs "License suspended" to the console. Otherwise, it logs the number of points to the console using string concatenation.

Usage
To use the Speed Detector, call the checkSpeed() function and pass the driver's speed as an argument to check the driver's speed status. The function will then log the appropriate message to the console.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
The Net Salary Calculator is a JavaScript program that calculates the net salary of a Kenyan employee. It does this by taking a basic salary and benefits as input and using several functions to calculate the payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and net salary.

Usage
To use the Net Salary Calculator, call the calculateNetSalary() function and pass the employee's basic salary and benefits as arguments. The function will then log the basic salary, benefits, gross salary, payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and net salary to the console.
